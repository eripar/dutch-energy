# dutch-energy

Dataset obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/lucabasa/dutch-energy).  Data contains electrical and gas use from the three major network administrators of the Netherlands (Enexis, Liander, and Stedin are) and, together, they provide energy to nearly the entire country. 

The data are anonymized by aggregating the Zipcodes so that every entry describes at least 10 connections.

This market is not competitive, meaning that the zones are assigned. This means that every year they roughly provide energy to the same zipcodes. Small changes can happen from year to year either for a change of management or for a different aggregation of zipcodes.

Content
Every file contains information about groups of zipcodes managed by one of the three companies for a specific year.
